# HSM library

This library is meant to help implementation of support for various kind of hardware security modules.

A software implementation is also available, allowing people to not use a HSM (if you want to test without needing any kind of hardware).

In order to use a HSM, you need to provide a "HSM" environment variable. For example HSM=software or HSM=yubihsm2.
